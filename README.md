**IBM IMS Operator collection**
========================

The **IBM® IMS Operator collection** provides automation for provisioning IBM Information Management System (IMS) on one or more z/OS endpoints and managing its lifecycle in a hybrid Cloud environment.


Import this collection into an instance of **z/OS Cloud Broker** running in RedHat OpenShift Container Platform to get started quickly. **z/OS Cloud Broker** generates a Kubernetes operator, making it easy to deploy IMS to a z/OS endpoint. For information, see the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSV97FN_latest/zstack/operators_ims.html).


**IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack**
===========================================
**IBM® IMS Operator** is part of **IBM Z® and Cloud Modernization Stack.** 
  
**IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack** brings together component capabilities from IBM Z into an integrated platform that is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Together, these capabilities help to modernize and simplify the use of z/OS software. 


For information, see the [IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSV97FN_latest/). 

**Features**
========
The **IBM IMS Operator collection** contains the following capabilities: 

* Ansible playbooks to provision IMS on z/OS 

* Ansible playbooks to de-provision IMS on z/OS 

This Ansible collection must be used with **z/OS Cloud Broker V2.2.3 or newer.** For all system requirements, see the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSV97FN_latest/zstack/system-requirements.html).

**Customization Guide**
=========
Please refer to the [Customization Guide](customization-guide.md) for more information on implementation details and how to customize this collection for your own environment.
